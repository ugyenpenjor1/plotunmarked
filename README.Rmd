# plotunmarked

![Package Logo](man/figures/logo_plotunmarked.png)

<!-- badges: start -->

The goal of **plotunmarked** is to provide convenient plotting functions for visualizing predictions from unmarked models, particularly occupancy estimates.

## Installation

You can install the development version of plotunmarked from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("ugyenpenjor1/plotunmarked")
# OR using devtools:
# devtools::install_github("ugyenpenjor1/plotunmarked")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(plotunmarked)
if (requireNamespace("unmarked", quietly = TRUE)) {
  # Example usage
  # model <- occu(~ detection ~ cov1, data = umf)
  # plot_occupancy(model, "cov1")
}
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
