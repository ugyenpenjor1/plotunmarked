\usage{
plot_modavg_response1(
  model_selection_table,
  full_model_list,
  covariate,
  fixed_vals = NULL,
  response_type = c("state", "det"),
  xlab = NULL,
  ci_level = 0.95,

  suppress_warnings = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{model_selection_table}{A model selection table, typically the result of \code{modSel()}
from the \code{unmarked} package. Can also be of class \code{unmarkedModSel}.}

\item{full_model_list}{A full \code{fitList} object containing all candidate models (not pre-filtered).}

\item{covariate}{Character. The name of the covariate for which the response curve will be plotted.}

\item{fixed_vals}{Named list. Fixed values for other covariates not being plotted.
If not provided, these covariates are set to zero by default.}

\item{response_type}{Character. Whether to plot response for \code{"state"} (occupancy) or \code{"det"} (detection).
Default is \code{"state"}.}

\item{xlab}{Character. Custom label for the x-axis. If \code{NULL}, the function uses the covariate name.}

\item{ci_level}{Numeric. Confidence interval level (default is 0.95).}

\item{delta_cutoff}{Numeric. The ΔAIC threshold for selecting models to include in model averaging (default is 2).}

\item{suppress_warnings}{Logical. If \code{TRUE}, warnings about unspecified covariates being set to zero are suppressed.}
}
\value{
A \code{ggplot2} object showing the model-averaged predicted response curve, with confidence intervals.
}
\description{
Generates a model-averaged response curve for a single covariate based on a
set of occupancy or detection models, selected using a ΔAIC threshold.
}
\details{
This function computes model-averaged predictions from an \code{unmarkedFitList} of occupancy models.
It supports plotting either the state (occupancy probability) or detection probability (\code{type = "det"})
for a specified covariate. All other covariates are either held constant at user-specified values (\code{fixed_vals})
or at zero.

For detection probability curves, the covariate can be either site-level or observation-level.
If it is observation-level, the function constructs a design matrix with consistent values across surveys.

Models are filtered based on ΔAIC cutoff, and model-averaged predictions are weighted by relative AIC weights.
